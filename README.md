## Project Overview

Stay App is a smart house rental system developed as an Android application. It aims to simplify the process of finding and managing rental properties for both homeowners and renters. The app offers a seamless user experience with various features that facilitate property listings, searches, and communications between landlords and tenants.

## Objectives

The Stay App project aims to:
- Provide a platform for homeowners to list their rental properties.
- Allow users to search for available rental homes in different areas.
- Enable communication between property owners and potential renters.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for managing rental properties and tenant information.

## Target Audience

### House Owners
- **Profile**: Individuals or organizations looking to rent out their residential properties.
- **Requirements**: Easily add new properties and tenants, track existing tenants, and manage rental listings efficiently.

### Renters/Users
- **Profile**: Individuals or families looking to rent a house.
- **Requirements**: Communicate with property owners, quickly locate available rental homes, obtain comprehensive property information, and view property locations on a map.

## Features

1. Two primary panes: Sign up as a user or homeowner.
2. Homeowners can add new rental homes.
3. Users can view the location of houses on a map.
4. Homeowners have the authority to add new occupants.
5. Both users and homeowners can see all residents of a property.
6. Users can view all rental homes listed on the app and click on any property for more information.
7. The app administrator can add or remove unnecessary data.

## Project Description & Limitations

### Current Framework
- The current system involves manual record-keeping of tenant and property details.
- Communication between tenants and property managers is typically through phone or email.
- This manual system is prone to errors, slow responses, and extensive paperwork.

### Limitations
1. Inconsistent data entry leading to inaccuracies.
2. High ongoing staff training costs.
3. Dependence on individual reliability.
4. Security, customer service, and information exchange deficiencies.
5. Time-consuming and costly report preparation.

## Technologies Used

### Software Requirements
- **Android Studio**: Development environment for building Android apps.
- **Java**: Backend programming language for developing app logic.
- **XML**: Used for designing the app's user interface.
- **Firebase**: NoSQL database for real-time data management and user authentication.

### Hardware Requirements
- Computer system with at least 8 GB RAM and 8 GB available disk space.
- Keyboard and mouse.
